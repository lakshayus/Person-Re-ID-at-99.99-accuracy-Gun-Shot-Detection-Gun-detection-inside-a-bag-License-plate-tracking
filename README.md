Task 1: Gun Audio Classification
Description: This task involves the classification of audio samples to identify the presence of gunshots. The process utilizes Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features for classification.

Task 2: Gun Detection
Description: In this task, we employ computer vision techniques to detect guns within images. The provided code demonstrates object detection, including the visualization of the detected objects.

Task 3: License Plate Tracking
Description: This task centers around recognizing and tracking license plates within images. OpenALPR is used for license plate recognition, and the code includes visualizations.

**and rest are in source code**

Visualization and Demonstration
Description: The project provides code examples for visualizing and demonstrating the results of each task. These demonstrations include visualizations of audio samples, detected guns, and recognized license plates.

Usage
Description: Instructions for using and running the provided code examples are detailed within each respective section. It's important to note that certain libraries and dependencies may need to be installed before executing the code.
